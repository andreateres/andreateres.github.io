<h1 class="header2">Learn your protections</h1>
    <p class="paragraph1">Knowing your rights and liberties as a journalist - and citizen of your country - are crucial to the work of press organizations. While knowing how to defend your voice and information once you’re in trouble is definitely helpful, the best course of action when publishing anything is to review it beforehand. This practice, better known as pre-publication review, is not about self-censorship; nor does it promote the chilling effect among citizen journalists. Instead, knowing how to reduce legal risk prior to publication should help journalists feel confident that they have the tools needed to cover tough subjects without worry. The main things to look out for when conducting pre-publication review are Libel, Privacy & Leaked Information, and Copyright & Trademark. A review of these terms is available under the <i>Can I Publish This?</i> tab.

<h1 class="header2">Know who's on your side</h1>
    <p class="paragraph1">If you work for your university paper or radio, chances are that you have an advisor or coordinator that works with your respective school. Regardless of whether the university is public or private, there are resources (some provided by your university coordinator, others not) to help your publication if it were to ever and in a sticky situation. Some of these resources may be located within your university, while others may be their own separate organizations. Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), Student Press Freedom Initiative (SPFI), Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and the Student Press LawCenter (SPLC) are all example of organizations dedicated to helping students defend their first amendment rights and have access to legal and professional resources for reporting and publication.</p>

    <h1 class="header2">What would you do?</h1>
    <p class="paragraph1">Do you know what steps you would need to take if you received an email from an angry reader asking for a story to be taken down? What about a subpoena request? Or perhaps threats of legal action against your publication? What if your student media advisor tried to censor you, or block a story from being published? Can a university cease distribution of your newspaper or cut funds? All of these are questions a journalist hopes to never have to face, but it’s better to be prepared than sorry. The information and resources shared in this website will help prepare students to understand these situations, and know how to take action to prevent and resolve them.</p>

<h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
<h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>

<p>By Beth Skwarecki</p>

<img width="650" height="450" src="fit1.jpg">

<p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>

<p>So let’s look at some of the ways gamification of health habits can backfire. Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson explains the most common game tactics here, and that’s worth a read if you haven’t checked it out yet. Gamification is usually just manipulation, and it often has more downsides than benefits.</p>

<h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>

<p>Consistency in the long term is what matters to your body. Streaks only matter to app developers. Why do you think the Apple Watch wants you standing for 12 hours each day? It’s so you wear their watch during all your waking hours. The “stand” goal is programmed into the app because it benefits Apple, not you.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
    


</ul>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
