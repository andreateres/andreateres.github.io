<h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
<h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>

<p>By Beth Skwarecki</p>

<img width="650" height="450" src="fit1.jpg">

<p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>

<p>So let’s look at some of the ways gamification of health habits can backfire. Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson explains the most common game tactics here, and that’s worth a read if you haven’t checked it out yet. Gamification is usually just manipulation, and it often has more downsides than benefits.</p>

<h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>

<p>Consistency in the long term is what matters to your body. Streaks only matter to app developers. Why do you think the Apple Watch wants you standing for 12 hours each day? It’s so you wear their watch during all your waking hours. The “stand” goal is programmed into the app because it benefits Apple, not you.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
    


</ul>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
