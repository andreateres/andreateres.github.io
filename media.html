  <h1 class="header2">Libel
  </h1>
  <p class="paragraph1">Libel is defamation of someone's character in written or broadcast form. Although it is not protected under the First Amendment, standards exist in the courts to prove whether something is or isn't libel. As long as the published information meets the standards of [standards], a journalist cannot be held accountable even if the work caused harm to the individual or group's reputation. One of the most popular supreme court cases that made clear the role of the First Amendment in protecting the ability of people to criticize public figures in their community is the 1964 case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.</p>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>Popular Case:</b> <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</i></p>
  <p class="paragraph1">An ad appeared in the New York Times asking for donations for a Martin Luther King fund. The ad made false statements about the misconduct of police officers in the area, and Sullivan sued for libel because although he was not named, some of the readers of the ad thought it was inferring that Sullivan was responsible for this misconduct as supervisor of the police department. He won the case, though four years later the Supreme Court overturned the Alabama courts on the grounds that the state did not do enough to protect first amendment rights if it allowed public officials to win lawsuits against critics of their official conduct. The ruling reaffirmed the notion that freedom of expression must protect the ability of people to criticize their own government and government officials. Created the standard of actual malice.</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">Information is considered libelous if:</p>   
  <ul>
    <li>There is enough context provided to identify a particular individual</li>
    <li>Contains defamatory language</li>
    <li>The statement is false</li>
    <li>The information has been published</li>
    <li>The publisher acted under standards of actual malice (meaning they knew the information was false and published it anyway. This standard leaves room for error). </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="paragraph1">The best defenses against libel suits are the following:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Truth: the published information can be proven true</li>
    <li>Opinion: the published information can be identified as opinion (this one's a bit tricky, statements of fact cannot be passed off as opinions. For example, one cannot say, “In my opinion, Senator X stole the money.” Instead, the writer would have to say, “In my opinion, Senator X has made poor decisions with his spending.”).</li>
    <li>Non-malicious: there is evidence that the reporter did his/her research and published the information with the well-informed assumption that it was true. They did not act out of malice or ignorance.</li>
  </ul>

<h1 class="header2">Privacy & Leaked Information</h1>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>What is right to privacy?</b> Simply put, it addresses a person's right to be left alone, without his or her name, image, or daily activities becoming public property.</p>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>Where do journalists, or people who work with the press, find limitations when it comes to publishing private information or requesting private records?</b> The important thing to note here is that statutes requiring financial or medical records to be kept confidential are part of privacy law, but the First Amendment does give access to some areas involving public issues. Right to privacy is recognized by statute in most states, case history or as a constitutional mandate, though legal definitions vary from state to state.</p>
  <p class="paragraph1">How do the courts distinguish <i>private</i> versus <i>public</i> property? “Reasonable expectation of privacy,” as noted, is the guiding phrase courts use in deciding cases of intrusion. A state-supported university is “public property” in that it is publicly owned, but a student using a public restroom at a public university still has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Conversely, people sitting on the front lawn of their homes, easily visible to passersby, are on private property but have yielded their reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>The Four Torts of Privacy</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Intrusion upon personal solitude - Offense occurs when the information is collected: the intrusion itself. The information doesn't necessarily have to be published.</li>
    <li>Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts</li>
    <li>Appropriation of one's name or image for commercial gain</li>
    <li>Shining a false light on one's public identity.</li>

  <h1 class="header2"> Copyright & Trademark</h1>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>What is Copyright?</b></p> 
  <p class="paragraph1">A copyright legally protects the rights of authors and producers to their published or unpublished writing, music, lyrics, TV programs, movies, or graphic art designs.</p> 
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>How does a journalist know when they're at the risk of copyright infringement?</b></p>
  <p class="paragraph1">The main thing to avoid is appropriating a writer's or an artist's words, images, or music without consent or payment, as this is a form of expression not protected by the First Amendment.</p> 
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>When can previously copyrighted work be published?</b></p> 
  <p class="paragraph1">After the end of the copyright period, the work will enter the public domain, which gives the public free access to the work.</p>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>How should I respond to a copyright infringement notice?</b> Which steps should I take or avoid?</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Do not ignore the notice:</b> This can be interpreted as willful infringement and do more harm than good.</li>
    <li>Edit the matrial: If possible, remove the copyrighted material to show you weren't acting in malice.</li>
    <li>Consider the source: Who is asking you to take content down? Is it theirs, or is it a scam?</li>
    <li>Respond: Reply to the notice in writing explaining your situation. This might mean asking for more information, clarifying which parts of your content are being accused of copyright infringement, or informing the source that you recieved permission to publish the information.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="paragraph1"><b>Tips to make sure you're not infringing copyright:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask permission from the source to use their material.</li>
    <li>Pay for a license.</li>
    <li>Try to opt for sources already in the public domain.</li>
    <li>Use your own work.</li>
  </ul>
